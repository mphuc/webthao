                   <h3>An Introduction to Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology</h3>
                   <p>Bitcoin technology began to enter the public discourse in 2011, largely through its association as an anonymous payment system used on illicit and underground websites. As with most innovations that are first described in tabloid format, the story mischaracterized the technology and failed to identify the most important and varied potentials of what Bitcoin and its associated “Blockchain” technology promise. This primer will attempt to reboot your introduction to Bitcoin and convey some of the reasons why many in the financial and technology sectors are excited about its promise. A glossary of common terms appears at the end of this primer</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Bitcoin Overview</h3>
                    <p>Trying to explain Bitcoin in short form is no easy task; however, it helps when one understands what it is and is not. Bitcoin is an information technology breakthrough that facilitates both a secure, decentralized payment system and a tool for the storage, verification and auditing of information, including digital representations of value. A bitcoin is also the intangible unit of account that facilitates the decentralized computer network of Bitcoin users. Bitcoin is not a company or a company product. Contrary to many news reports, it is not anonymous and was not built for bad actors, though bad actors have, at times, brought Bitcoin into the headlines. </p>
                    <p>Bitcoin is important because it represents a new means of forming consensus reliably and promptly across time and geography. As currently designed, Bitcoin is an open and transparent system that allows all users to easily come to an agreement on the authenticity of transactions and information stored on the network, all without the need to involve a trusted third party and without the concern of censorship of information or value transmitted across the network.</p>
